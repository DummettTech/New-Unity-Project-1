<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This zip file
contains 1 crossbow smart prop with parented bolt prop for Daz|Studio,
Carrara and Poser. The files use external geometry in wavefront object
format so the model should be able to be loaded in most any 3d program
though it will be lacking morphs. The morphs are self contained within
the .pp2 file.<br><br>Textures,
bump maps and UV templates are also included. They are moderately high
rez so they should be suitable for close ups. I intend to make a few
different texture sets and some D|S specific material settings for this
model in the future. The current settings are intended for Poser 5+ so,
for now, D|S users may need to adjust the advanced material settings
for better results... In particular the specularity and bump levels.<br>

sometimes be a real pain to adjust and properly place things like swords,
guns etc. into the hands of figures in a scene so I have included prop
poses to scale the crossbow and move it to the right hand of several
popular human 3d figures including <a href="http://www.daz3d.com/?refid=856765989">Micheal 4, Micheal 3, Victoria 4,
Aiko 3, Hiro 3</a> and <a href="http://www.antonkisieldesigns.com/%7Eakfiles/htmlpages/ApolloMaximusFree3dhumanfigure.htm">Apollo Maximus</a>. The poses aren't perfect and some
fine tuning will undoubtedly be needed but they should help get the
prop in the ball park.<br><br>Because the crossbow loads parented, but in a confusing location, I
have included a few to describe how I designed the loading and posing
of the crossbow. <br><br>This should work essentially the same in Poser, Daz|Studio or Carrara 6.<br></div><br><br><br><br><br>
